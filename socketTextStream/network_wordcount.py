# First, we import StreamingContext, which is the main entry point for all streaming functionality. 
# We create a local StreamingContext with two execution threads, and batch interval of 1 second.

from pyspark import SparkContext
from pyspark.streaming import StreamingContext

# Create a local StreamingContext with two working thread and batch interval of 1 second
sc = SparkContext("local[2]", "NetworkWordCount")
ssc = StreamingContext(sc, 1)

# Using this context, we can create a DStream that represents streaming data from a TCP source, specified as hostname (e.g. localhost) and port (e.g. 9999).

"""
## Logging levels
## ALL: Enables all logging messages.
## DEBUG: Provides detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
## INFO: Provides informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at a high level.
## WARN: Indicates potentially harmful situations that still allow the application to continue running.
## ERROR: Indicates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
## FATAL: Indicates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
## OFF: Turns off logging.
## TRACE: Provides more detailed information than DEBUG, often used for fine-grained debugging.

sc.setLogLevel("ERROR")

# Create a DStream that will connect to hostname:port, like localhost:9999
lines = ssc.socketTextStream("localhost", 9999)

# This lines DStream represents the stream of data that will be received from the data server. 
# Each record in this DStream is a line of text. 
# Next, we want to split the lines by space into words.

# Split each line into words
words = lines.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" "))


# flatMap is a one-to-many DStream operation that creates a new DStream by generating multiple new records from each record in the source DStream. 
# In this case, each line will be split into multiple words and the stream of words is represented as the words DStream. Next, we want to count these words.

# Count each word in each batch
pairs = words.map(lambda word: (word, 1))
wordCounts = pairs.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: x + y)

# Print the first ten elements of each RDD generated in this DStream to the console
wordCounts.pprint()

# The words DStream is further mapped(one-to-one transformation) to a DStream of(word, 1) pairs, which is then reduced to get the frequency of words in each batch of data. 
# Finally, wordCounts.pprint() will print a few of the counts generated every second.
# Note that when these lines are executed, Spark Streaming only sets up the computation it will perform when it is started, and no real processing has started yet. 
# To start the processing after all the transformations have been setup, we finally call:

ssc.start()             # Start the computation
ssc.awaitTermination()  # Wait for the computation to terminate
