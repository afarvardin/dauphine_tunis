# Final Project (Data Streaming course)

**Deadline for Project delivery**:  Mid of December 2024

## Project definition
- Use an API of your choice (e.g., Binance API, Rapid API, etc.) to get a streaming flow of some stocks (i.e., AAPL, NFLX, Goog, Amzn, bitcoin, etc.) or a topic of your interest into Kafka.

- The project aims to ingest data from Kafka (OR directly ingest from API if you get stuck) and detect related data with Apache Flink in sliding Windows operation with a window length 10 minutes and slide length of 1 minute (I would appreciate it with an extra mark if you could come up with the new length of windowing and sliding size if you explain why).
- The captured data must be presented visually for better understanding.
- How should you filter the data? I let you to use your creativity. :-)


**Submit the project as a GitHub repository**
- To do that, everyone has to create his/her own **PRIVATE** GitHub repository and work on that.
- You must add me as a contributor (from the settings) in your **Private** repository otherwise I can not see your work.
- Highly recommended to push every step of the project that you have done to your repository.
- Finally, submit your repository as a final version of your work.
- The code should be runnable on my machine too!

For this purpose:

**The GitHub repository should contain:**
- An README aside to your code, and explain how the project has to run
- The README should also include a screenshot of the visualization data
- Providing a readme named "README_GPT" that contains all of the questions that you had from AI (ChatGpt, Mistral, Perplexity, etc.)

**The Resources that you may find helpful**
- **For windowing concept in data streaming**: Chapter 6, section _Windows operations_ from the __Stream Processing with Apache Flink Book__.
- **An interesting YouTube tutorial for visualization (in Python)**: [Matplotlib Tutorial (Part 9): Plotting Live Data in Real-Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ercd-Ip5PfQ&list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_&index=10)

## Bonus
