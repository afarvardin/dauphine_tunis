# The Course Project

Using [Twitter Streaming API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/connectors/datastream/twitter/) 
to get flow-streaming tweets about the current _inflation_ or whatever topic you find interesting.

- The project aims to detect related data in Sliding windows operation with fix length of 10 minutes and slide size of 8 minutes.
- The captured data must present visually for better understanding.
- How you should filter the data? I let you use your creativity :-)

**Submit the project as a GitHub repository**
So, every member of a team has to create his/her own branch and work on that.
Finally, a group has to submit one repository as a final version of the work.
