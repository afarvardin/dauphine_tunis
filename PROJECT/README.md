# The Course Project

**Project delivery**: Before April 2023

Using [Twitter Streaming API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.13/docs/connectors/datastream/twitter/) 
to get a streaming flow of tweets about the current _inflation_ or whatever topic you may find interesting.

- The project aims to detect related data in Sliding windows operation. Explain the logic that you will use as a fixed length and slide size.  
- The captured data must present visually for better understanding.
- How you should filter the data? One option could be hashtags. But, I let you use your creativity. :-)


**Submit the project as a GitHub repository**
- So, every member of a team has to create his/her own branch and work on that.
- Finally, a group has to submit one repository as a final version of the work.
- The code should be runnable on my machine too!

**The GitHub repository should contain**
- Aside from the code, in the README, explain how the project is going to run, the logic behind, etc.
- The README should also include a screenshot of the visualization data.



**The Resources you may find helpful**
- **For windowing concept in data streaming**: Chapter 6, section _Windows operations_ from the __Stream Processing with Apache Flink Book__.
- **An interesting YouTube tutorial for visualization**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ercd-Ip5PfQ&list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_&index=10
