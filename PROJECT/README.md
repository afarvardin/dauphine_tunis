# The Course Project

**Project delivery**: Before April 2023

Use an API of your choice (e.g., Binance API, Rapid API) to get a streaming flow of some stocks (i.e., AAPL, NFLX, Goog, Amzn, bitcoin, etc.) or whatever topic you may find interesting.

- The project aims to detect related data in sliding Windows operation. Explain the logic that you will use as a fixed length and slide size.  
- The captured data must be presented visually for better understanding.
- How you should filter the data? I let you to use your creativity. :-)


**Submit the project as a GitHub repository**
- To do that, every member of a team has to create his/her branch and work on that.
- Finally, a group has to submit one repository as a final version of their work.
- The code should be runnable on my machine too! 

**The GitHub repository should contain**
- Aside from the code, in your repo README, explain how the project has to run, the logic behind it (e.g., windowing size and length, etc.), etc.
- The README should also include a screenshot of the visualization data.



**The Resources you may find helpful**
- **For windowing concept in data streaming**: Chapter 6, section _Windows operations_ from the __Stream Processing with Apache Flink Book__.
- **An interesting YouTube tutorial for visualization (but in Python)**: [Matplotlib Tutorial (Part 9): Plotting Live Data in Real-Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ercd-Ip5PfQ&list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_&index=10)
